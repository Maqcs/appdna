#Analyze applicationsTo retrieve the algorithm results for a set of applications, for a given ReportConfiguration, the applications must first be analyzed. Analysis of applications is triggered either from a ReportConfiguration object or from the object returned by Server.ReportConfiguration.For a single module, use the ReportConfiguration object's Analyze method; for example:
```
using AppDNA = Citrix.SDK.AppDNA;
AppDNA.Server appdna;
//Connect appdna

	public void Analyze(string reportConfigIdentifier, IEnumerable<AppDNA.Application> applications)
	{
		var reportConfig = appdna.ReportConfiguration.Get(reportConfigIdentifier);
		var analysis = reportConfig.Analyze( applications ); analysis.WaitForCompletion();
	
		switch (analysis.ProcessingState.State)
		{
			case AppDNA.RunningState.Canceled:
				Console.WriteLine("The analysis was canceled");
				break;
			case AppDNA.RunningState.Completed:
				Console.WriteLine("The analysis completed successfully");
				break;
			case AppDNA.RunningState.Failed:
				Console.WriteLine("The analysis failed with error: " + analysis.ProcessingState.Result:;
				break;		}	}```
For analyzing multiple modules, use the Server.ReportConfiguration.Analyze method, which is more efficient. For example:
```
public void Analyze(IEnumerable<AppDNA.Application> applications)	{		var allReportConfigurations = appdna.ReportConfiguration.Get();		var enabledReportConfigurations = new List<AppDNA.ReportConfiguration>();
		foreach (var config in allReportConfigurations)		{			if (config.Enabled) enabledReportConfigurations.Add(config);		}		var analysis = appdna.ReportConfiguration.Analyze(enabledReportConfigurations, applications);		analysis.WaitForCompletion();		switch (analysis.ProcessingState.State)		{			case AppDNA.RunningState.Canceled:
				Console.WriteLine("The analysis was canceled");
				break;			case AppDNA.RunningState.Completed:
				Console.WriteLine("The analysis completed successfully");
				break;
			case AppDNA.RunningState.Failed:
				Console.WriteLine("The analysis failed with error: " + analysis.ProcessingState.Result)
				break;		}	}```
**Note**: Do not attempt to analyze using a disabled reportConfiguration or an exception will occur.
##Monitoring progress

Use the Analysis object returned from a call to Analyze to monitor the progress and success of the analysis. Analysis.ProcessingState implements INotifyPropertyChanged so that, for example, a GUI application can update controls with details of the analysis as it proceeds.

The return from WaitForCompletion does not provide any indication of the success or otherwise of the analysis. To get an indication, check the Analysis.ProcessingState.State property. The WaitForCompletion method waits until the analysis is no longer running, while still allowing event handlers to be raised on the current thread's SynchronizationContext.

To wait for completion without running the current thread's SyncronizationContext, run a loop waiting for Analysis.IsFinished to return true, typically with a Thread.Sleep(â€¦) call inside the loop.
